    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An omelet is a savory dish made from beaten eggs quickly cooked in a
      frying pan, sometimes folded around a filling such as cheese, vegetables,
      or meat. Omelets can be served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Heat the butter or oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and let it cook for a few seconds
        until the bottom begins to set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spatula, gently lift the edges of the omelet and tilt the
        skillet so that the uncooked egg mixture can flow underneath.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue cooking until the omelet is set on the bottom and cooked
        through.
      </li>
      <li>Add your desired fillings to one half of the omelet.</li>
      <li>Fold the omelet in half and slide it onto a plate.</li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately with your favorite toppings, such as salsa, sour
        cream, or avocado.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For a fluffier omelet, add a splash of water or milk to the egg mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be careful not to overcook the omelet, or it will become dry and tough.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can add any toppings you like to your omelet. Some popular toppings
        include cheese, vegetables, and meat.
